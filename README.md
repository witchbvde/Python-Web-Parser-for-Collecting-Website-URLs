This Python web parser is a powerful tool designed to extract and collect data on all the URLs utilized within a given website. 
Using the BeautifulSoup library and requests module, the parser navigates through the website's HTML structure, identifying and capturing links to other pages, resources, or external websites. The collected URLs can be further processed, analyzed, or stored for various purposes, such as web indexing, data analysis, or generating sitemaps. With its versatility and efficiency, this web parser becomes a valuable asset for web developers, researchers, and data analysts seeking to gain insights into a website's link structure and navigation patterns.
